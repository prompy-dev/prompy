Consider adding: 1) Desired style/tone, 2) Length requirements, 3) Specific themes beyond 'cats', 4) Structure (sonnet, haiku, etc). Example improvement: 'Write a 12-line poem about cats' hunting behavior at night. Use a mysterious tone with vivid imagery and include a metaphor comparing cats to shadows.'"}]}

Strengths: Clear subject and focus. Areas for improvement: 1) Add length constraints, 2) Specify audience level (general or expert), 3) Request specific aspects of tactics (artillery usage, formations, etc.), 4) Indicate if you want analysis or just description. Revised version: 'Write a 500-word explanation of Napoleon's tactical decisions at Waterloo for a high school history student. Focus on his artillery deployment and infantry formations, and analyze why these tactics ultimately failed.'"}]}
